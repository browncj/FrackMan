StudentWorld:
	-Implement actual initialization. Right now, certain objects are just
added in set spots

Protester:
	-Implement rest of logic for protester movement

FrackMan:
	-Do not add squirt onto field if starting location is not valid

-Try and make as many methods const as possible
-Try to tell if frackman is alive (in FrackMan::doSomething() and in StudentWorld::move()) using
   isAlive(), not directly looking at the life count?
-Every time there's a variable like (distanceSquared) or (distance), change it to use
   the withinRadiusOf function
-Test on Visual Studio
