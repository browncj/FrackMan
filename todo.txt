     Frackman:
	-A lot of stuff, including checking of the FrackMan is being blocked
	by a boulder

Boulder:
	-In doSomething() method, check if boulder comes within a certain
	radius of protesters or the FrackMan

StudentWorld:
	-Implement actual initialization. Right now, four boulders
are just added in a set spot
    	 -If there are no oil barrels left, go on to the next level

Squirt:
	-In frackman class: check if initial squirt location is occupied by
	dirt object, or within a radius of a boulder object
	-In squirt class: check if within 3.0 radius of a protester, also
	check if gets blocked by dirt or a boulder

In general:
   -Try and make as many methods const as possible
   -Try to tell if frackman is alive (in FrackMan::doSomething() and in StudentWorld::move()) using
   isAlive(), not directly looking at the life count?
